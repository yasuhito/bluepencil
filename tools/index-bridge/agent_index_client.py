Collects from three places, because none alone covers a real machine:
  * agentsview, the same index the Builder Index client reads. Rich and correct
    for claude and codex. Measured on v0.38.1: grok reports zero, fixed
    upstream in 0.39.0; hermes reports zero with no fix known.
  * the Hermes store directly, because of that hermes gap — Hermes is what our
    own agents run on, so relying on agentsview alone puts them on the board at
    zero.
  * the OpenClaw store directly, for the same reason: current OpenClaw keeps
    transcripts in per-agent SQLite rather than the session files agentsview
    reads, so an OpenClaw agent reports zero without it.

Sends, per call: --register posts the page content you hand it (agent id,
name, blurb, repo, runtime, video, images, install-url, logo), all of it public
because it IS the agent's page, plus one id for this install -- random, made
up here once and kept, so the Index can tell two installs of one agent apart
instead of adding them together (on an id somebody else published the page is
refused and kept as theirs, and only that install id is used, to mint this
install's report key); a report posts day x model token counts and
nothing else; --story posts the one story you wrote, and --delete-story removes
one. No prompts, no task titles, no file paths, no costs -- the only thing
MEASURED off this machine and sent is the token counts. Everything else is
what you typed, or that one id, which is drawn from random bytes and says
nothing about the machine.
Reports use the stored Index-issued key; the Plow token is used only once to
exchange for an assertion during registration.
